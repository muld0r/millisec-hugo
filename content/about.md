Welcome to Millisec, where we specialize in comprehensive security assessment and engineering services tailored for government, finance, aviation, and automotive sectors. With a focus on robust security solutions, our expert team ensures your systems are fortified against cyber threats, safeguarding critical infrastructure and sensitive data. Partner with us for proactive defense strategies and building systems robust against attack.

## Our Objectives, Culture and Ethos
Our objects, culture and ethos stem from one simple idea:
 > Don't get hacked.

It's as simple as that. Whatever the most effective path is to achieving that, we'll take it. For different customers, that might look different. We shy away from document-heavy engagements to spend more time helping our customers make improvements to their environments. PDFs and Conference calls are a necessary evil, but they don't stop breaches.

## Our Team
Our team is compromised of a network of security proffesionals vetted by a small number of trusted individuals which we've worked with over decades.
